What about the fully-capable computers that we have with us all the time, our smartphones? Some moments on our day to day lives are very well suited for voice interactions: while in a car or cooking for example. Let's not forget that voice interactions are extremely accessible, not only in a physical way (for people with dexterity or motion impediments) but also in a cognitive way (I think we all have a loved one in our lives that really struggles with technology, and people from some emerging countries have very limited access to computers and are not at ease with technology).\\n\\nIn this talk, I'll explain what integrations can be done on Flutter apps:\\n- Flutter Packages that take advantage of APIs provided by Google or Apple\\n- Other packages that integrate with other solutions such as ML Kit, TensorFlow and Dialogflow\\n- 3rd-party solutions such as Porcupine, Snips, Amazon Lex, Snowboy and PocketSphinx\\n- On Android: Integration with the Google Assistant via App Actions\\n- On iOS: Integration with Siri (SiriKit, Siri Shortcuts)\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"}],\"nodeType\":\"document\"}",

On a more granular level, we will discuss events, states, transitions, as well as Flutter-specific components including BlocBuilder, BlocListener, and BlocProvider.
